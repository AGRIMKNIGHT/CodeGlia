    "explanation": "This is 'Command Injection', a severe vulnerability where an application uses user-supplied data to construct and execute a command on the underlying operating system. If the input is not carefully sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious commands (e.g., `127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd`). This directly leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to run any command on the server, potentially gaining full control, accessing sensitive data, or disrupting services.",

    "explanation": "This finding points to 'Command Injection'. It means that user input (`$host`) is being directly concatenated into a command executed by the `shell_exec` function. Without proper sanitization, a malicious user can inject additional commands by crafting special characters (e.g., `&&`, `||`, `;`) into the `$host` variable. This puts the server at extreme risk, enabling Remote Code Execution (RCE), where an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to full system compromise or data exfiltration.",
